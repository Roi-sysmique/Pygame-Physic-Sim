# 2D Physics Simulation with Pygame

This project is a **2D physics simulation built using Pygame**, focused on realistic ball motion and robust collision handling.

## Features

- 🔴 Ball-to-wall collisions (vertical, horizontal, and arbitrary walls)
- 🔵 Ball-to-ball collision handling using vector mathematics
- 🌍 Gravity and acceleration

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to **experiment with 2D collision detection and response**, understand common physics problems such as tunneling and penetration, and implement stable, realistic solutions using vectors and reflection.

This project is designed as a **learning and experimentation tool** for game physics and simulation systems.
